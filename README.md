# 12grid-framework

In this project, I get to take everything I’ve learned through "The Odin Project" HTML and CSS section and use it to build my own simple grid-based framework.
This includes a CSS reset, a fixed number of grids separated by “gutters”, a way to make new rows, and default values.
The framework consists of 12 columns that are fully flexible. Check out the live demo in order to better understand how to work with the layout.
